# TempConv
A simple TUI temperature converter I wrote as my first project in C#.
  
## Frameworks
I used Microsoft .NET 8 for the sake of cross-compatibility.  
Supported systems (include but not limited to): 
- Windows 10/11
- Linux
- macOS

This has been tested **only** on Windows 10, but it should run on any device supported by .NET.  
Also, the included Visual Studio project and solution were made in __MSVS Community 2022 ver. 17.14.5__, **check compatibility before building** if you have an old version.
